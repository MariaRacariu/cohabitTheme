                <p>Once thrown out, only a small percentage of furniture is recycled.</p>
                <p>According to the statistics from the European Federation of Furniture Manufacturers (UEA), around 80% to 90% of the EU furniture waste in the municipal solid waste stream is incinerated or sent to a landfill and only less than 10% are recycled.</p>
                <p>The environmental impact of “fast furniture” is significant and calls for a change in consumer behavior to address this (seemingly) overlooked concern.</p>

                            <p>We’re all about giving pre-loved furniture a fresh start.</p>
                            <p>Everything begins with recognizing that a lot of good quality and functional furniture sits around in someone’s basement – or, even worse – ends up in the trash because people no longer need it. Even some circular businesses deal with unsold furniture destined for the same fate – and that’s where Cohabit comes in.</p>
                            <p>Cohabit steps in to find new homes for these items. We collaborate with individuals and various circular businesses to connect these valuable resources with those searching for a more sustainable furniture option. This approach prevents good furniture from becoming waste and retains the value of resources.</p>

                            <p>Pre-loved furniture is awesome for a few key reasons:</p>
                            <p>First, it’s eco-friendly. It’s like giving a high-five to the planet because you’re not using up more resources.</p>
                            <p>Second, these pieces might have a few little “love marks” – tiny scratches or dents – but that doesn’t stop them from doing their job. Plus, those marks can make them kind of cool and unique.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, if you’re a student or need furniture for a short time, choosing pre-loved stuff is a smart move. It’s gentle on your wallet and better for our world. So, you save money and help the environment. Double win!</p>
                            <p>Pre-loved furniture is sustainable, has character, and won’t break the bank – a top choice for anyone looking for affordable, eco-friendly options.</p>

            <p>Cohabit is a circular furniture rental startup based in Malmö, Sweden.</p>
            <p>As  former international students, we have experienced first-hand the  challenges students face when it comes to furnishing their empty  apartments – and yes, it’s quite stressful!</p>
            <p>Launched  in 2022, Cohabit aims to make sustainable consumption convenient,  accessible, and affordable by providing pre-loved furniture for rent.  Initially intended as a project for our Social Entrepreneurship, Social Innovation, and Sustainability course,  we realized the potential for Cohabit, given the number of  international students who move to Sweden – and experience the same  problem – annually. </p>
            <p>Today, our services are available in Malmö  and Lund, and aim to expand to other major student cities in the near  future, so join the movement and choose circularity with Cohabit! </p>
